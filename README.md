A simple AJAX tutorial with PHP
=================

In order to get the tutorial to work you'll need to save them in your web folder. You'll also need PHP 5 installed and running. Additionally you'll have to edit the URL in index.php to reflect where you have saved the files. 

To read the tutorial, you must open the files and look at the source code.

Good luck!
